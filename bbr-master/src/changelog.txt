# Changelog

## BBR' (in tcp-bbr.h)

v1.7 - Added PROBE_RTT_MIN_TIME as a constant for easier adjustments.
       Changed bbr::MIN_CWND to be in units of bytes for clarity.
       Modified PROBE_RTT so controls pacing rate in Send() since
          TCP_PACING may have backlogged packets.

v1.6 - Updated cwnd response to packet loss (RTO and Fast Recovery).
       Changed BW estimates to ignore retransmission sequences.
       Moved most NS_LOG messages from INFO to LOGIC.

v1.5 - Changed BW window culling to use packet-timed round trip time
       instead of wall-clock round trip time.  Wall-clock remains a
       config option.

v1.4 - Updated BBR' PktsAcked() to ignore acks when sending time 
       unknown (e.g., during retransmission sequence).

v1.3 - Re-worked RTT and BW windows to use actual times.
       Added configuration option for pacing/non-pacing/tcp-pacing.
     
v1.2 - Re-factored state code to use FSM for BBR states.

v1.1 - Added PROBE_RTT state.

v1.0 - Initial version.


## TCP Pacing (in tcp-socket-base.h)

v1.1 - Fixed bug in TcpSocketBase to clear any remaining packets
       in pacing queue when RTO.

v1.0 - Initial split with version numbers for TCP pacing and BBR'.
